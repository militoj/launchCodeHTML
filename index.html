      <h1 class="header"> I went to Spain for Christmas. It's not a big ol' deal. </h1>
      <p>I was in Spain during Christmas-time this year. Were you in Missouri? Sounds cold.</p>
      <h2>Arcos de la Frontera</h2>
      <p>My favorite travel book, 1000 Places to See Before You Die, suggested taking the Ruta de Los Pueblos Blancos (Route of the White Towns) which connects Arcos de la Frontera on the western end to Ronda on the east. Many of the towns in the area still bear the "de la Frontera" or "on the border" suffix which dates back to the time when the Spanish were still trying to wrest control of the area back from the Moors of Northern Africa.
